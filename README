# Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a simple, two-player implementation of the classic game Noughts and Crosses (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe). The game is written in C and is played directly in the command line.

## Features

*   Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay.
*   Two-player mode (Player 1 is 'X', Player 2 is 'O').
*   Command-line interface with a clear, coordinate-based board.
*   Automatic detection of win, lose, and draw conditions.
*   Basic input validation to prevent placing a piece on an occupied square.

## Getting Started

To run this game, you will need a C compiler (like `gcc`) installed on your system.

### Compilation

1.  Make sure you have both `main.c` and `main.h` in the same directory.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to that directory.
3.  Compile the code using the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o tictactoe
    ```

### Running the Game

After successful compilation, an executable file named `tictactoe` (or `tictactoe.exe` on Windows) will be created. Run it with the following command:

```bash
./tictactoe
```

## How to Play

The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid. The rows and columns are indexed from 0 to 2.

```
Current Game Board:

   0 1 2
0
1
2
```

1.  The game will start by asking Player 1 ('X') to make a move.
2.  Enter the **row number** (0, 1, or 2) for your desired move and press `Enter`.
3.  Next, enter the **column number** (0, 1, or 2) and press `Enter`.
4.  The board will be updated and displayed.
5.  Player 2 ('O') will then be prompted to make their move.
6.  The players alternate turns until one player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until the board is full, resulting in a draw.
7.  The game will announce the winner or the draw and then exit.
